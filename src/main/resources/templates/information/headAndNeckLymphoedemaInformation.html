        <h1 id="what-is">What is Head and Neck Lymphoedema?</h1>
        <section>
            <p>Head and neck lymphoedema is an accumulation of fluid in the tissues of the head and neck region, often resulting from surgery or radiation therapy associated with cancer treatment. This condition leads to swelling and can impact daily activities. Early recognition and management are critical to improving outcomes and maintaining quality of life.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Causes Section -->
        <section id="causes">
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>Head and neck lymphoedema is typically caused by damage to the lymphatic system due to surgery or radiation therapy for cancer. This damage impairs the system’s ability to drain lymphatic fluid, leading to swelling. Other causes can include infections, injuries, or congenital abnormalities that affect lymphatic drainage.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Symptoms Section -->
        <section id="symptoms">
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Persistent swelling in the face, neck, or around the eyes</li>
                <li>A feeling of fullness or tightness in the affected areas</li>
                <li>Changes in skin texture</li>
                <li>Reduced flexibility in the neck or jaw</li>
                <li>Difficulty with daily activities due to swelling or discomfort</li>
                <li>Symptoms that worsen in the morning and improve throughout the day</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Risk Factors Section -->
        <section id="risk-factors">
            <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
            <p>The risk of developing head and neck lymphoedema increases with the following factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Extensive surgery or radiation therapy in the head and neck region</li>
                <li>Obesity or being overweight</li>
                <li>Infections or injuries to the lymphatic system</li>
                <li>Pre-existing venous conditions</li>
                <li>Lack of physical activity following surgery</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Diagnosis Section -->
        <section id="diagnosis">
            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>Diagnosis is made through a combination of physical examination and imaging techniques, such as lymphoscintigraphy, to visualize the lymphatic system. Measurements and patient history also play crucial roles in assessing the extent of lymphoedema and planning appropriate treatment.</p>

        <!-- Treatment Section -->
        <section id="treatment">
            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>Treatment for head and neck lymphoedema typically involves a combination of physical therapy, compression garments, and exercises. Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) is a specialized massage technique that may also be recommended. Consistent management is key to improving outcomes and maintaining quality of life.</p>

            <h3>Skin and Oral Care</h3>
            <p>Proper skin care is crucial to prevent infections such as cellulitis:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Moisturize the neck, chin, and cheeks daily with a non-perfumed moisturizer. Apply with gentle downward strokes towards your neck and collar bone.</li>
                <li>Keep your skin hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids.</li>
                <li>Use non-perfumed products to cleanse the skin. Pat the skin dry; do not rub or cause friction.</li>
                <li>Use a high-factor sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) when exposed to sunlight.</li>
                <li>Avoid shaving with a razor; use an electric shaver to reduce the risk of cuts. Avoid facial waxing, electrolysis, or facial bleach.</li>
                <li>Treat any skin breaks promptly with antiseptic cream.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Manual and Simple Lymphatic Drainage</h3>
            <p>Manual lymphatic drainage is a gentle massage technique that helps move excess fluid from swollen areas to where the lymphatic system is functioning well. This should be done daily and may be a long-term requirement.</p>
            <p>For a demonstration, watch the video below:</p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=Fm41JFONNq1RB5mw&v=POTVcQAnyZw&feature=youtu.be">Watch Video on Lymphatic Drainage</a>

            <h3>Exercises for Head and Neck Lymphoedema</h3>
            <p>It is important to keep the head, neck, and shoulders mobile where possible throughout and after treatment. Specific exercises can be given to encourage movement that can help improve swallowing and lymphatic drainage.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deep breaths – take 5 deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth.</li>
                <li>Shrug shoulders 10 times.</li>
                <li>Push shoulders forward and back - repeat 10 times.</li>
                <li>Push chin forwards and then back to create a double chin - repeat 10 times.</li>
                <li>Turn head to the left - repeat 10 times.</li>
                <li>Turn head to the right - repeat 10 times.</li>
                <li>Take your left ear to your left shoulder - repeat 10 times.</li>
                <li>Now do the same with your right ear - repeat 10 times.</li>
                <li>Look up at the ceiling - repeat 10 times.</li>
                <li>Now look down to the floor - repeat 10 times (make sure chin is tucked in).</li>
                <li>Now say your vowels – AEIOU in an exaggerated manner - repeat 5 times.</li>
                <li>Smile 5 times.</li>
                <li>Poke out your tongue as far as you can - repeat 5 times.</li>
                <li>Open your mouth as wide as you can - repeat 5 times.</li>
                <li>Frown and screw up your eyes and face - repeat 5 times.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Garments</h3>
            <p>Compression garments are a common treatment for lymphoedema. For head and neck oedema, options include collars or bands to apply gentle pressure and assist lymphatic drainage. Your therapist will look at the best options for you and advise when to wear this.</p>

            <h3>Kinesio Tape</h3>
            <p>Kinesio tape can help lymphatic drainage by lifting the skin in the affected area or as a support/correction strip. It can also be used for scar/fibrosed tissue.</p>

            <h3>Positioning</h3>
            <p>Lymphoedema in the head and neck often worsens overnight. Raise the head of your bed or use pillows to elevate your head. A wedge pillow may also help with positioning.</p>
